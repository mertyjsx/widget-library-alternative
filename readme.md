# Widget Library Alternative (REACT + WEBPACK)



This widget has been prepared for Easysize.me in accordance with the following criteria 
 - The library can be loaded into any e-commerce product page
 - The library is configurable and is launched with a trigger
 - After that trigger, a button should be added to the placeholder element
 - When that placeholder button is clicked, a widget/model/iframe should open containing your React app
 - The react app should contain at least two tabs/pages/screens, implementation is your choice
 - First screen should visualise the image of the product and a button 'Surprise me'
 - When that button is clicked, a loading indicator should show up, with a 'randomising your choice' gif, animation or something alike
 - After a couple of seconds, the last screen should show up, showing the randomly selected attribute and a button 'Select me'
 - When that button is clicked, you should select that attribute on the product page and close your widget/model/iframe
